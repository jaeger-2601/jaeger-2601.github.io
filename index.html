<p>Hello there, stranger 😄👋. Make yourself at home.</p>

<p>In this website, I post some personal projects and articles on subjects that I find interesting. 
    I also list my contributions to free/libre/open source software.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer, currently working in Morgan Stanley.
  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Technology from PSG College of Technology
</p>

<p>
  As you can see in this personal page, I really enjoy doing side-projects that
  not exactly aim to be useful, but different, challenging and, above all,
  fun.
</p>

<p>
  Some things that I like (and you can see it by reading my posts here):

  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>👨‍💻 Programming, in general</li>
    <li>💰 Finance/Economics </li>
    <li>⚡ Electronics, even though I have never formally studied it</li>
    <li>🎬 Movies, no matter the year they were made</li>
    <li>📚 Learning how stuff works, sometimes opening their hood</li>
  </ul>
